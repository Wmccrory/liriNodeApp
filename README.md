# liriNodeApp
A command line node app that takes in parameters and returns information

# Notes
-CLI definitely has pros and cons. It helps you work purely with your javascript, but it does make it harder to watch it all 'come together' like on an html page.

-Node is a godsend in terms of cleaning up code and making it easier to work with.

-This homework I worked on understanding scope. When to use global variables, when not to use global variables. How functions can take data and work with external sources. How to mask sensitive information and how to write concise code. After finishing up the javascript on this homework, I looked at the first javascript I wrote and the difference is night and day. I can only hope to continue to improve in my understanding and implementation of code. No more "every variable is global" mindset.

-Certain logical steps are becoming more familiar and instinctual. Things like getting the data out of random.txt and implementing it would have taken me probably half a day even just a week ago, but now were figured out in about 10 minutes. In fact, I ran into a very similar scoping problem in an earlier homework that tripped me up for a very, very long time and in this homework was hardly a stumble.
